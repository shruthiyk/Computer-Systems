Getting familiar with the terminal is a fundamental skill to have. Many of you have various levels of experience using the terminal.

For this assignment, you will be warming up by writing a 1-2 page tutorial on how to use the terminal to do something non-trivial on the command line by building a shell script. An example of a non-trivial script would be a few lines of code that sorts a particular column of data from a .csv file. You can use your imagination to continue further.

The tutorial can be purely text, and you should upload a file called 'tutorial.txt'. I *strongly* encourage you to use a tool like 'vim', 'emacs', or 'nano' to write your tutorial. I personally use the vim text editor.

## Very Brief Example Tutorial (Template)
(Note this example is fairly trivial)

* Problem Statement: "Often I have to search for different files and directories within my computer system. In order to do this I use the 'ls' command to help orient myself.
* Name of command: ls
* Example of its usage: 
```
-bash-4.2$ ls
Lab1  README.md
```

* Here is the list.sh script that can list the directories and how many total directories are in the current folder.

``` 
ls
ls | wc -l
```
