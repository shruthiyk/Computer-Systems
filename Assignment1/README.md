Getting familiar with the terminal is a good skill to have. Many of you have various levels of experience using the terminal.

For this assignment, you will be warming up by writing a 1-2 page tutorial on how to use the terminal to do something non-trivial and building a shell script.

Examples of trivial commands are like 'ls', 'cd', 'mkdir' etc.


## Brief Example (Template)
(Note this example is fairly trivial)

* Problem Statement: "Often I have to navigate to different directories within my computer system. In order to do this.
* Name of command: ls
* Example of its usage: 
```
-bash-4.2$ ls
Lab1  README.md
```

* Here is the list.sh script that can list the directories and how many total directories are in the current folder.

``` 
ls
ls | wc -l
```
