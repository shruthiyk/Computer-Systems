# Monorepo

Welcome to Computer Systems!

This is a graduate level course, and the expectations are graduate level work. That means we will get to do some real cool projects that are related to the real world!

Okay, let's get started!

## Learning git
If you are not familiar with git, you can quickly learn the basics of how it works in about 15 minutes.

## github and this course

This course utilizes git because:

- It is good real world skill to have.
- It is easy for me to monitor your progress and receive your assignments for grading.
  - (You will also never e-mail me code snippets, I can just look!)
- In order to receive your assignments, you simply do 'git pull' after I have released them.
  - This will make sense after trying the tutorial if you are new to git.

That being said, I can only grade what you have **pushed** to your repo. Make sure to push your latest changes to your repo. The timestamp tells me when your file was submitted as well.

## Monorepo

A monorepo is known as a 'monolithic' repository. Comapnies like Google for instance have nearly all of their code from every single employee in one single repository. Some companies choose to have many separate repositories. Which strategy would you think is better? Take a moment to think about it, and you can read more on the 'why' (at least for Google) here: https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext
