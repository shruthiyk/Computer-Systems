# Final Project

Please fill out the proposal below. The range of projects for this course is wide, and can be anything Systems related (Even topics we have not covered such as databases, security, etc). The sidequests listed on the webpage may be example projects, or you may want to take a homework/lab substantially further. For your final project, think of this as a project that takes about 3x the effort of a homework. You may use other Systems languages(D, C++, Go, Rust, etc.) if it makes sense for the domain of the problem you are trying to solve.

For the final project you are expected to have a functioning tool, application, library, or framework that I can run. Additional deliverables will include a brief writeup and video demonstrating your tool in action. I see the final project as something you can be proud to put on your resume/portfolio!

## Proposal

** Fill this part out by July 3rd **

Who will you be working with (Max of 3 members--working solo is fine if you choose)?
  * Teammate 1: (Your name)
  * Teammate 2: ?
  * Teammate 3: ?

If you are looking for team members, you can use this spreadsheet to get in contact with folks and make a pitch.
(Your final team members information should be in the spreadsheet and in this README.md)

### In one sentence, describe your project.

*Edit this example with your own*

*Example: We are going to build a profiling tool for monitoring the performance of C game applications*

### What is the minimum deliverable for this project?

*Edit this example with your own bulleted list*

*This should include a list of things with a brief description of features you think you need*

*Example: We will build a binary instrumentation tool and instrument every C library function.*

### What is the maximum deliverable for this project?

*Edit this example with your own bulleted list*

*Example: In addition to the features above, we are going to build an interactive GUI that lets us pause the program while it is running, and investigate performance characteristics related to memory, the call stack, and threads.*

### What tools or environment will you be using?

*Edit this example with your own bulleted list*

*Example: We will be using C11, Python for the GUI, and running our tests on Ubuntu Linux 16.04*

### What are your first step(s)?

*Edit this with your own thoughts in about a paragraph*

*We will review slides from lecture X. We will then find some sample programs that we have the source code to, and make sure we compile them.*

### Find at least one related publication or tool and reference it here.

*Edit this*

*Telmetry Performance Visualization System is a similar tool: http://www.radgametools.com/telemetry.htm*

### What is the biggest problem you foresee or question you need to answer to get started?

*Edit this with your own thoughts in about a paragraph*

*I do not know anything about how accurate the timing functions are on my operating system. I worry it will be difficult to understand how other processes, my cpus architecture, and the operating system may affect both the accuracy and precision of our tool*

### Instructor Feedback

*Your instructor will write a short note here if this is an acceptable project.*

*Your instructor will give you some range of the grade you can earn if you meet all of your deliverables.* e.g. [B+/A-/A]
